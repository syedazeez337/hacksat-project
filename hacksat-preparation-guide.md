## Understanding the Challenge

### Overview
HackSAT is a "Hack a Satellite from the Inside" challenge that focuses on satellite payload security and application development. The competition is hosted at [hacksat.dev](https://hacksat.dev/) and is organized by Parsimoni in partnership with DPhi Space.

### Challenge Tracks
1. **Use Case Contest Track (Track 1)**
   - Develop innovative applications for the SpaceOS platform
   - Applications will be evaluated based on functionality, resource usage, and innovation
   - Winners get the opportunity to test their software in orbit

2. **Cybersecurity Track (Track 2)**
   - Focus on finding security vulnerabilities in the satellite system
   - Attempt to disrupt operations, bypass resource quotas, or compromise the system
   - Winners may receive job opportunities and cash prizes up to 10,000 EURO

### Evaluation Criteria
- **Track 1**: Functionality, innovation, resource efficiency, practical applications
- **Track 2**: Creativity of attack vectors, impact of discovered vulnerabilities, technical sophistication

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Required Programming Languages
The challenge requires software to be written in one of these languages:
- C
- C++
- Rust
- OCaml

### Development Environment Setup

#### For C/C++
```bash
# Install GCC compiler and development tools
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential gdb cmake

# For macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install gcc cmake llvm

# For Windows
# Install MinGW or use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
```

#### For Rust
```bash
# Install Rust using rustup
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Verify installation
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

#### For OCaml
```bash
# For Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install ocaml opam

# For macOS
brew install ocaml opam

# Initialize OPAM and install compiler
opam init
eval $(opam env)
opam switch create 4.14.0
eval $(opam env)
```

### IDE Recommendations
- **Visual Studio Code** with extensions for your chosen language
- **CLion** for C/C++
- **IntelliJ IDEA** with Rust plugin
- **VSCode** with OCaml Platform extension

## Learning About Satellite Systems

### Key Concepts to Understand
1. **Satellite Architecture**
   - Hardware components
   - Communication systems
   - Power management
   - Payload operations

2. **SpaceOS Platform**
   - Operating system architecture
   - Resource management
   - Inter-process communication
   - Security model

3. **Satellite Communications**
   - Protocols
   - Bandwidth limitations
   - Latency considerations
   - Error handling

### Simulated Environment
The challenge provides a simulated satellite environment with:
- Payload computers
- Simulated sensors
- Communication interfaces
- Resource constraints similar to actual satellites

## Unikernel Development

### What is a Unikernel?
Unikernels are specialized, single-address-space machine images constructed by using library operating systems. They're highly optimized for specific applications and have a smaller attack surface than traditional operating systems.

### Unikernel Frameworks
Depending on your chosen language:

#### For OCaml
- **MirageOS**: A library operating system that constructs unikernels
  ```bash
  # Install MirageOS
  opam install mirage
  ```

#### For C/C++
- **Unikraft**: A unikernel construction toolkit
  ```bash
  # Clone Unikraft repository
  git clone https://github.com/unikraft/unikraft.git
  ```

#### For Rust
- **Unikraft** with Rust support
- **Nanos**: A unikernel designed to run one application with minimal overhead

### Building Your First Unikernel
1. Start with a simple "Hello World" application
2. Package it as a unikernel using the appropriate framework
3. Test it locally before submission

## Track-Specific Preparation

   - Side-channel attacks
   - Protocol vulnerabilities

2. **Security Testing Techniques**
   - Fuzzing
   - Static analysis
   - Dynamic analysis
   - Penetration testing methodologies

3. **Develop Attack Strategies**
   - Identify potential entry points
   - Understand resource allocation mechanisms
   - Analyze inter-process communication
